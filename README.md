# Transient identification and interpretation of real-time pressure data from modern well surveillance systems



### Develop three methods
- Method based on tangent 
- Method based on derivatives 
- Pattern recognition

### Design a 5-steps workflow
- Denoising
- Coarse filtering 
- Methods pipeline
- Task 1 processing
- Task 2 processing
  
### Propose a learning & predicting procedure for method `Pattern recognition`

### Deploy web app
