# Transient identification and interpretation of real-time pressure data from modern well surveillance systems

### Poster to introduce project 
[Click here](https://github.com/juneciel510/transient_identification/blob/main/poster_LejunChen1.pdf)

### Develop three methods
- Method based on tangent 
- Method based on derivatives 
- Pattern recognition

### Design a 5-steps workflow
- Denoising
- Coarse filtering 
- Methods pipeline
- Task 1[^1] processing
- Task 2 processing

[^1] To detect the start points for shut-in & flowing periods.

### Propose a learning & predicting procedure for method `Pattern recognition`
